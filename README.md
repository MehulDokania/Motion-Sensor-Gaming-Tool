# Motion-Sensor-Gaming-Tool
Created a belt and a gun gaming accessory/product in C using Arduino Nano, 
NodeMCU and MPU6050 microcontrollers, which you can use to play any game on the computer. 
The belt and the gun detect your motion and send the data over WiFi to the computer. 
This is fully functional and compatible with any game on PC. 
Created a variation of Kalman and Complementary filter for the gyroscopes to accurately detect motion.
